# The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model which can be used to help us to form the best investment portfolio of the selected stocks to generate the maximum returns

# Team members: 

* Damien: TSLA, Amazon

* Luis: BHP, LendLease

* Abigail: Commbank and RBS

* Tracy: Riotinto and American Express (Amex)

# Outline Scope 

* Find data sources for each stock and copy & paste the links to the class channel for recording
* Prepare the data source links and read the data
* Store the data into DataFrames for further analysis 
* Data preparation and refining
* Data split for traing and testing purpose
* Standard scalize the splitted training data for prediction purpose
* Establish prediction models using LogisticRegress and other model 
* Train the model using training Data
* Test the model to see the accuracy
* General plot to compare the actual return and predicted return. 
* Use another model to back test the used model
* Refine the model to improve the prediction accuracy by adjusting short and long simple moving average (SMV)
* Generate a plot to see the improvement of the prediction. 
* use optimized model to predict the future market movement to decide what portfolio we should form for investment
* Snap the results using PNG file to review the potentials
* Predict the potential returns based on that formed portfolio
* Snap the results as PNG file to present
* Prepare the presentation using the above PNG files and model information to tell our approaches and achievements. 
* Load the presentation to the repository for assignment submission

# Date slice period for Each Stock

* Train Date: Jan to Dec 2022
* Test Data: Jan to Mar 2023
* Use model to predict the purchase or sell of stocks from April to December 2023

![AI-Stock-750x350.png](AI-Stock-750x350.png)

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model which can be used to help us to form the best investment portfolio of the selected stocks to generate the maximum returns.
## Background 
The implementation of machine learning models and algorithmic trading in the financial industry has enabled traders to make faster, more time-efficient transactions with minial human errors. The supervised learning model we chose is not only able to perform more efficiently than human traders, it is able to simplify 
## FinTech Techniques Used 
1) Machine learning - neural network, logistic regression
2) Algo trading 
## Model Evaluation
We validate the performance of our model in two ways - hold-out validation through splitting data into training and testing sets and back testing using a second model.
